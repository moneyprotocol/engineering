Liquity is a decentralized protocol that allows Ether holders to obtain maximum liquidity against
their collateral without paying interest. After locking up ETH as collateral in a smart contract and
creating an individual position called a "trove", the user can get instant liquidity by minting LUSD,
a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each trove is required to be collateralized at a minimum of 110%. Any
owner of LUSD can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time. The redemption
mechanism along with algorithmically adjusted fees guarantee a minimum stablecoin value of USD 1.

An unprecedented liquidation mechanism based on incentivized stability deposits and a redistribution
cycle from riskier to safer troves provides stability at a much lower collateral ratio than current
systems. Stability is maintained via economically-driven user interactions and arbitrage, rather
than by active governance or monetary interventions.

The protocol has built-in incentives that encourage both early adoption and the operation of
multiple front ends, enhancing decentralization.

## About this repo

This repository hosts an early preview of the Liquity codebase until we get ready to open it up completely. Development continues to take place in a private repository, from which this repository is derived using [git filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo).

## Running Dev UI with Docker

The quickest way to get Dev UI up and running is to use the [prebuilt image](https://hub.docker.com/r/liquity/dev-frontend) available on Docker Hub.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

### Running with `docker`

```
docker pull liquity/dev-frontend
docker run --name liquity -d --rm -p 3000:80 liquity/dev-frontend
```

This will start serving Dev UI using HTTP on port 3000. If everything went well, you should be able to open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. To use a different port, just replace 3000 with your desired port number.

To stop the service:

```
docker kill liquity
```

### Running with `docker-compose`

See [packages/dev-frontend/docker-compose.yml](packages/dev-frontend/docker-compose.yml) for a simple example of docker-compose configuration.

### Configuring a public Dev UI

If you're planning to publicly host Dev UI, you might need to pass the Docker container some extra configuration in the form of environment variables.

#### FRONTEND_TAG

If you want to receive a share of the LQTY rewards earned by users of your Dev UI, set this variable to the Ethereum address you want the LQTY to be sent to.

#### INFURA_API_KEY

This is an optional parameter. If you'd like your Dev UI to use Infura's [WebSocket endpoint](https://infura.io/docs/ethereum#section/Websockets) for receiving blockchain events, set this variable to an Infura Project ID.

### Setting a kickback rate

The kickback rate is the portion of LQTY you pass on to users of your Dev UI. For example with a kickback rate of 80%, you receive 20% while users get the other 80. Before you can start to receive a share of LQTY rewards, you'll need to set this parameter by making a transaction on-chain.

It is highly recommended that you do this while running Dev UI locally, before you start hosting it publicly:

```
docker run --name liquity -d --rm -p 3000:80 \
  -e FRONTEND_TAG=0x2781fD154358b009abf6280db4Ec066FCC6cb435 \
  -e INFURA_API_KEY=158b6511a5c74d1ac028a8a2afe8f626 \
  liquity/dev-frontend
```

Remember to replace the environment variables in the above example. After executing this command, open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser with MetaMask installed, then switch MetaMask to the account whose address you specified as FRONTEND_TAG to begin setting the kickback rate.

## Building Dev UI from source

If you want to customize the functionality or look of Dev UI, or you don't want to use the Docker image, you'll need to build it yourself from source.

### Prerequisites

Node v12 and Yarn v1.

### Install dependencies and build libraries

Inside the root directory of the repo:

```
yarn
```

### Start Dev UI in development mode

```
yarn start-dev-frontend
```

This will start Dev UI in development mode on http://localhost:3000. The app will automatically be reloaded if you change a source file inside `packages/dev-frontend`.

If you make changes to a different package, it is recommended to rebuild the entire project with `yarn prepare` in the root directory of the repo.

### Build optimized Dev UI for production

```
cd packages/dev-frontend
yarn build
```

You'll find the output in `packages/dev-frontend/build`.

### Configuring your custom Dev UI

Your custom built Dev UI can be configured by putting a file named `config.json` inside the same directory as `index.html` built in the previous step. The format of this file is:

```
{
  "frontendTag": "0x2781fD154358b009abf6280db4Ec066FCC6cb435",
  "infuraApiKey": "158b6511a5c74d1ac028a8a2afe8f626"
}
```

## Supplying Hints to Trove operations

Troves in Liquity are recorded in a sorted doubly linked list, sorted by their NICR, from high to low. NICR stands for the nominal collateral ratio that is simply the amount of collateral (in ETH) divided by the amount of debt (in LUSD), without taking the ETH:USD price into account. Given that all Troves are equally affected by Ether price changes, they do not need to be sorted by their real ICR.

All Trove operations that change the collateralization ratio need to either insert or reinsert the Trove to the `SortedTroves` list. To reduce the computational complexity (and gas cost) of the insertion to the linked list, two ‘hints’ may be provided.

A hint is the address of a Trove with a position in the sorted list close to the correct insert position.

All Trove operations take two ‘hint’ arguments: a `_lowerHint` referring to the `nextId` and an `_upperHint` referring to the `prevId` of the two adjacent nodes in the linked list that are (or would become) the neighbors of the given Trove. Taking both direct neighbors as hints has the advantage of being much more resilient to situations where a neighbor gets moved or removed before the caller's transaction is processed: the transaction would only fail if both neighboring Troves are affected during the pendency of the transaction.

The better the ‘hint’ is, the shorter the list traversal, and the cheaper the gas cost of the function call. `SortedList::findInsertPosition(uint256 _NICR, address _prevId, address _nextId)` that is called by the Trove operation firsts check if `prevId` is still existant and valid (larger NICR than the provided `_NICR`) and then descends the list starting from `prevId`. If the check fails, the function further checks if `nextId` is still existant and valid (smaller NICR than the provided `_NICR`) and then ascends list starting from `nextId`. 

The `HintHelpers::getApproxHint(...)` function can be used to generate a useful hint pointing to a Trove relatively close to the target position, which can then be passed as an argument to the desired Trove operation or to `SortedTroves::findInsertPosition(...)` to get its two direct neighbors as ‘exact‘ hints (based on the current state of the system).

`getApproxHint(uint _CR, uint _numTrials, uint _inputRandomSeed)` randomly selects `numTrials` amount of Troves, and returns the one with the closest position in the list to where a Trove with a nominal collateralization ratio of `_CR` should be inserted. It can be shown mathematically that for `numTrials = k * sqrt(n)`, the function's gas cost is with very high probability worst case `O(sqrt(n)) if k >= 10`. For scalability reasons (Infura is able to serve up to ~4900 trials), the function also takes a random seed `_inputRandomSeed` to make sure that calls with different seeds may lead to a different results, allowing for better approximations through multiple consecutive runs.

**Trove operation without a hint**

1. User performs Trove operation in their browser
2. Call the Trove operation with `_lowerHint = _upperHint = userAddress`

Gas cost will be worst case `O(n)`, where n is the size of the `SortedTroves` list.

**Trove operation with hints**

1. User performs Trove operation in their browser
2. The front end computes a new collateralization ratio locally, based on the change in collateral and/or debt.
3. Call `HintHelpers::getApproxHint(...)`, passing it the computed nominal collateralization ratio. Returns an address close to the correct insert position
4. Call `SortedTroves::findInsertPosition(uint256 _NICR, address _prevId, address _nextId)`, passing it the same approximate hint via both `_prevId` and `_nextId` and the new nominal collateralization ratio via `_NICR`. 
5. Pass the ‘exact‘ hint in the form of the two direct neighbors, i.e. `_nextId` as `_lowerHint` and `_prevId` as `_upperHint`, to the Trove operation function call. (Note that the hint may become slightly inexact due to pending transactions that are processed first, though this is gracefully handled by the system that can ascend or descend the list as needed to find the right position.)

Gas cost of steps 2-4 will be free, and step 5 will be `O(1)`.

Hints allow cheaper Trove operations for the user, at the expense of a slightly longer time to completion, due to the need to await the result of the two read calls in steps 1 and 2 - which may be sent as JSON-RPC requests to Infura, unless the Frontend Operator is running a full Ethereum node.

### Hints for `redeemCollateral`

`TroveManager::redeemCollateral` as a special case requires additional hints:
- `_firstRedemptionHint` hints at the position of the first Trove that will be redeemed from,
- `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint` hints at the `nextId` neighbor of the last redeemed Trove upon reinsertion, if it's partially redeemed,
- `_upperPartialRedemptionHint` hints at the `prevId` neighbor of the last redeemed Trove upon reinsertion, if it's partially redeemed,
- `_partialRedemptionHintNICR` ensures that the transaction won't run out of gas if neither `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint` nor `_upperPartialRedemptionHint` are  valid anymore.

`redeemCollateral` will only redeem from Troves that have an ICR >= MCR. In other words, if there are Troves at the bottom of the SortedTroves list that are below the minimum collateralization ratio (which can happen after an ETH:USD price drop), they will be skipped. To make this more gas-efficient, the position of the first redeemable Trove should be passed as `_firstRedemptionHint`.

#### First redemption hint

The first redemption hint is the address of the trove from which to start the redemption sequence - i.e the address of the first trove in the system with ICR >= 110%.

If when the transaction is confirmed the address is in fact not valid - the system will start from the lowest ICR trove in the system, and step upwards until it finds the first trove with ICR >= 110% to redeem from. In this case, since the number of troves below 110% will be limited due to ongoing liquidations, there's a good chance that the redemption transaction still succeed. 

#### Partial redemption hints

All Troves that are fully redeemed from in a redemption sequence are left with zero debt, and are closed. The remaining collateral (the difference between the orginal collateral and the amount used for the redemption) will be claimable by the owner.

It’s likely that the last Trove in the redemption sequence would be partially redeemed from - i.e. only some of its debt cancelled with LUSD. In this case, it should be reinserted somewhere between top and bottom of the list. The `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint` and `_upperPartialRedemptionHint` hints passed to `redeemCollateral` describe the future neighbors the expected reinsert position.

However, if between the off-chain hint computation and on-chain execution a different transaction changes the state of a Trove that would otherwise be hit by the redemption sequence, then the off-chain hint computation could end up totally inaccurate. This could lead to the whole redemption sequence reverting due to out-of-gas error.

To mitigate this, another hint needs to be provided: `_partialRedemptionHintNICR`, the expected nominal ICR of the final partially-redeemed-from Trove. The on-chain redemption function checks whether, after redemption, the nominal ICR of this Trove would equal the nominal ICR hint.

If not, the redemption sequence doesn’t perform the final partial redemption, and terminates early. This ensures that the transaction doesn’t revert, and most of the requested LUSD redemption can be fulfilled.
