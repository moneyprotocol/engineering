/*
 * The Stability Pool holds BPD tokens deposited by Stability Pool depositors.
 *
 * When a vault is liquidated, then depending on system conditions, some of its BPD debt gets offset with
 * BPD in the Stability Pool:  that is, the offset debt evaporates, and an equal amount of BPD tokens in the Stability Pool is burned.
 *
 * Thus, a liquidation causes each depositor to receive a BPD loss, in proportion to their deposit as a share of total deposits.
 * They also receive an RBTC gain, as the RBTC collateral of the liquidated vault is distributed among Stability depositors,
 * in the same proportion.
 *
 * When a liquidation occurs, it depletes every deposit by the same fraction: for example, a liquidation that depletes 40%
 * of the total BPD in the Stability Pool, depletes 40% of each deposit.
 *
 * A deposit that has experienced a series of liquidations is termed a "compounded deposit": each liquidation depletes the deposit,
 * multiplying it by some factor in range ]0,1[
 *
 * --- MP ISSUANCE TO STABILITY POOL DEPOSITORS ---
 *
 * An MP issuance event occurs at every deposit operation, and every liquidation.
 *
 * Each deposit is tagged with the address of the front end through which it was made.
 *
 * All deposits earn a share of the issued MP in proportion to the deposit as a share of total deposits. The MP earned
 * by a given deposit, is split between the depositor and the front end through which the deposit was made, based on the front end's kickbackRate.
